It might be a little tricky to set up in PagerDuty by timezones, but we could start this style of rotation (similar to how we handled the holidays in December), beginning in April once @owenniblock and @andrialexandrou join the pool in PagerDuty.\n\nI recognize that, as the team grows and awareness of our program picks up steam, FRs will be pinged on more and more reviews.

We should have a process that can scale…\n\nI propose eliminating incidental FR responsibilities, specifically “Note-taking in planning meetings” and “Reporting epic status”. Doing so unlocks extra FR capacity to focus on incoming requests for review. This is the FR’s most valuable contribution, and it’s the one they are uniquely situated to provide.\nRe: Note-taking in planning meetings, I’d advise dropping this entirely: The project board is a sufficient artifact of our “sprint planning meetings”, and our move to async refinement means we no longer hold “backlog grooming meetings” during which notes could be taken.\nRe: Reporting epic status, as last week’s FR, I added little value to the content given to me by each epic’s DRI. At best, I merely reminded them that the content needed to be submitted, but we have alternative means to send reminders that do not require human action. I posit that DRIs are the best folks to submit epic statuses, since they have the relevant context as a matter of course, as a result of being DRIs.",

Would this be tracked based on how many issues we close because when we get to them, they're stale?\n\n\nWould it be relevant to add how often we plan on doing audits for each feature once they're healthy? Thinking of a complement to \"Last audit date\" - \"next audit date\"?\nWould we benefit from tracking frequency of common issues? This may be covered in \"Axe errors\". For example, if we track the amount of images missing alt text, and then see that number significantly decrease, that may be helpful. Similarly if we see that number start to spike - it could give us insight into what types of training/linting rules we should focus on.\n\nI will add more notes if I can think of them 😄",

Instead, I join via Zoom, either on my phone or my computer, which is authorised to access my PAC calendar.\n\nThe additional context is that I have quite a lot of meetings, many of which are non-GitHub, to the point that I just turn up where and when my phone's reminders tell me to turn up.  Right now, for the Office Hours and Deep Dive, I always get at least two reminders, with different Zoom links, and then am not sure which one to join.\nThis seems to be a shared problem, e.g. for yesterday's Office Hours, we had two Zoom meetings going on concurrently for a little while, each with participants.  It's relatively easy (albeit inefficient) to determine that you're in the wrong place when it's 5 minutes in, and nobody else has shown up.  But yesterday was a case of everyone thinking they were on the right call because other people were present, a perfectly natural reaction.\nSo, those are my concerns.  I want to limit confusion to maximise attendance, but hopefully in a way that just means having appropriate events on a calendar.  For instance, it was mentioned yesterday that some of the invites contain text in the description to help work out where to go, but that text isn't surfaced by the Zoom apps so isn't helpful to me personally.",

They strike a good balance between cost (friction) and value.\nPhilosophically, stylistic rules exist to improve readability and writeability through consistency. Because the primary reading interface for Markdown is the preview, not the raw form, stylistic rules provide less value for Markdown than for e.g. TypeScript files.

Today, we are launching Be My Eyes Support for LinkedIn to help answer product and accessibility questions.”",

There wasn't an audit planned for this person's area of work. They hadn't requested one from us. Where was this expectation for an audit coming from?\nHoping to learn more, I DMed this person and set up a sync meeting to learn more about this expectation. In our call, I learned they were very passionate about Accessibility work and hadn't been tuned into the new audit process we developed. Independent from our initiatives, they had been improving the Accessibility of their application slowly and surely, with support from their manager. In requesting \"Where's the audit?\" this Hubber was asking for ways to help.\nBy opening a door to talk via video and following up with a DM, the confusion was cleared up. This person wasn't communicating disappointment, but making an offer to work with us. Doors were opened for future collaboration.\nA Suggested Rule\n\nDon't Assume Intention\nOr if focusing on the positive\nAsk clarifying questions to understand intent",

We all feel very passionately about Accessibility and I think the fact that you’ve reached out to us here shows that you’re willing to engage with us which is great - maybe one of our team could pair with you some time to show you how a screenreader operates and what the experience would look like on GitHub right now.

Especially for people new to the subject. We need to display deep empathy for folks who are new to accessibility and trying to learn.\n\nLike a lot of deep subjects, \"the more you know, the more you realize what you don't know\"\n\n\nPerfection is the enemy of good.\n\nI'm not sure how to articulate this so that it's more actionable but sometimes we have to focus on the wins that are within grasp rather than focus on the unattainable perfect solution. If a solution solves 99% of the a11y issues then that solution still moves us forward and is preferable to no solution at all.\n\n\nWe need to be relentless critics of our own platform.\n\nIf we see ways to improve our ability to make GitHub accessible, document the feedback and engage the team in discussion\n\n\nCelebrate often. Celebrate as broadly as possible.\n\nGiving people the virtual \"pat on the back\" for small wins will establish an association between \"doing accessibility\" and \"feeling great about the work i do\".\nLet others know about it! i.e., the feature team, the engineering team, the product team, Twitter",

In my opinion, it is in fact continuous, so in that light codification is important as a reminder to have the conversation, to check in, to re-assess. The set of rules is not the same as putting in the effort to stand by them, or to act in the spirit of them when the letter is not necessarily spelled out.\nWith all that in mind, after a few conversations, I think my proposal for a \"rule\" is brief but far-reaching:\nConsider the interactions with those outside our team a first order part of our work.\nI do think it's worth discussing specifics around tone of engagement, impact on our end users, timeliness (of responses if not work itself), emoji reacts, whether and when to prefer DMs or zoom calls, etc, but not sure I would want those things necessarily codified.\nOkay!

Our team has experienced friction due to diverging project timelines and priorities. Moreover, this work has prevented us from focusing1 on projects that specifically require accessibility expertise:\n\nAdding ERB support to the axe extension for VS Code\nRe-enabling axe scans for staff in production\nWriting GitHub Blog posts and team posts\nReviewing planned ships\nCurating and producing role-appropriate accessibility training\n\nProposal\nIn FY22Q2, we worked on audit issue burndown in Discussions. In FY22Q3, we pivoted—we worked on component solutions that scale product-wide. In FY22Q4, I propose we pivot again—Design Infrastructure’s increased headcount affords that team capacity to own component solutions, which affords us capacity to work on consulting (on components, on upcoming ships), training, and tooling, in support of an Accessibility Fundamental.\nFootnotes\n\n\nThis isn’t speculation; engineers on the Accessibility Team have explicitly stated this, e.g. “I’ve been planning on catching up with this meeting and writing the [Semantic HTML and ARIA Deep Dive] meeting notes all day…but been super focused on dialog work and didn’t want to break my train of thought.” ↩",

Just speaking from a place of my own personal preferences, I would be down for a break from components in Q4 after the intense time spent around tooltips (of which I still need to upstream) and then diving into the Dropdown spike. I feel excited by tooling work and would love for our team to have dedicated time for writing posts.\nI do acknowledge there's a lot of work still to do with Primer components and getting them remediated is very high-impact work, but the things you've proposed for next quarter are equally very high impact and we should devote time. If Primer team has the bandwidth to prioritize remediation of components, I think it makes sense for our team to dedicate time to the other areas currently neglected. I am thumbs up for your proposal!",

In my previous experience, churning on fixing issues/creating new components doesn't prevent others from popping up faster than we can fix. Educating other teams on accessibility and making them more self-serve (which is another one of our Initiatives) is what will maximize our success. Then, once more people are trained and know where to come for questions, we can spread the work of fixing components/creating more accessible components to the people doing the component work (as @smockle said). I don't think we should completely halt making accessible components, but maybe take a step back from being the main implementers and more of the outside consultants when it comes to accessibility.\nFrom doing the ActionMenu spike, I was able to get a glimpse of the process the Primer React team used for updating the ActionMenu PRC component. The collaboration with James before designing and building, looping him into the process during, and iterating on his feedback is a great example of how I see our team playing a similar role in future features/components/decisions etc.",

It can also involve other techniques, including but not limited to:\n\ninteractive exploration of the data;\nsonification of the data or trends within it (e.g. an ascending and descending tonal curve and/or stereo panning); and\nallowing the raw data to be downloaded or viewed in some form.\n\n\nBe careful about assuming that there is a fully accessible option out there as an alternative.  For example, I looked at the example linked to by @smockle; it does get some things right, e.g. offering access to the data as a table.  But at the same time, the amount of screen reader verbosity is overwhelming, and I had no idea how to actually interact with the chart itself at first glance.",

Even a bit before that, honestly. I was using Home Page Reader, out of IBM, at the time, which plugged in alongside  Netscape Navigator.\nAnyways, then this incorrect advice gained some popularity with the text-only browser crowd, except all those arguments have been moot for at least a decade, if not longer, because even the text only browsers support JavaScript. Think Links VS Lynx. Which, fun fact, always resulted in blind people saying \"the chain\" vs \"the cat\" to distinguish what they were emailing about :).\nAfter that, various myths based on partial truths got born e.g. it's slower with JAWS, but obviously it was because they were barely running in-process at the time, then some universities made that their rule, and so on.\nAt least this is what I recall.

In this case, the web. Whether we like it or not, we will have a large impact on open source and commercial products that win and products that lose.\nFor example, when GitHub chose Markdown as the markup language to use within comment boxes, this choice was a bad day for reStructuredText and AsciiDoc. The Markdown ecosystem goes from strength to strength partly because GitHub makes it a first-class citizen within GitHub.\nWhen GitHub choose Mermaid, GitHub is implicitly saying \"we choose this winner\". More and more people will choose Mermaid simply because GitHub did. This is bad for an accessible web.\nIt's also important to recognize that product changes related to user generated content (UGC) are different to other changes. GitHub give up a certain amount of ownership with UGC, therefore it's harder to update.\nAs the business grows so does our responsibility. I would recommend that we work to solve the following:\n\nHow do we prioritize short term bandaids described in the opening comment?\nHow do we make Mermaid a winner for everyone?\nWhen do we determine that Mermaid is actually a loser?\n\nFor example, if no accessibility changes are made in the next 12 months, would GitHub still recommend this format?\n\n\nIs there an alternative winner? If our due diligence included accessibility, what would we find?\nHow do we ensure that GitHub don't start using Mermaid in other places within the product?\nHow do we make sure that product decisions concerning user generated content always incorporate accessibility?\nHow do we do all this without delaying our accessibility roadmap?\n\nA successfully executed roadmap will have a larger and more meaningful customer impact than any changes to our approach to \"diagrams in markdown\"",

More/less often?\nI am not sure how much of a time commitment being a FR is, but maybe we could tack on some of the responsibility to this role. Some examples could be reviewing an article or paying attention to our team Twitter account (assuming we do this). Or, do we want to create a new group of interested individuals and rotate through them?\nRe: content creation, I like the idea of everyone being responsible for an article or two over a defined period of time, maybe a year? Just my personal opinion 😄\nWherever we post, it'd be great to have access to analytics to see how much engagement we're getting.\n\nWhere can we share all this content?\nI like the idea of a Twitter account, but I have hesitations about who will be responsible for it 😅\n\nHow do conference talks fit into this? Would we want to encourage the team to speak at conferences on these things once we get GitHub into a healthier place? I hope the answer is yes 😄\nThanks for thinking about all of this - it's super exciting to discuss and can greatly benefit the tech community.",

As a FR on Accessibility team, I am not aware of what work is taking place in Primer React ecosystem.

Can we minimize it, or is an inherent cost we need to plan around?\nIncidentally, the same comment justifies a rotation (and other fan-out investments):\n\nRisk: We're getting more and more requests for detailed reviews / audits from other teams. This is good for us as a company (more care for accessibility!) but also means a strain on our team resources to do these reviews and it hampers our ability to work on components and close issues.\nMitigation: We need additional resources to work on accessibility. We are also working on documentation to better enable teams to learn. However, this will not be available until Q3/Q4 and it will need resources to improve it beyond Q4.",

While it's not standard behavior, it also shouldn't do any harm. If we can document this and even announce it in some blog, we could get the word out there about the behavior.\nEssentially, the hovercard should appear on focus or on hover and be able to be closed with esc without removing focus. If a sighted keyboard user wants to interact with the links in any way, they can move focus and access the card with alt + up arrow. Same with a screen reader - if they want a preview of information without having to open a new window they can move focus with the alt + up arrow shortcut.\nA method like this will likely take significant scrutiny to implement the needed custom roles and behaviors, but I think it can be done appropriately!\nI'm planning on talking to Scott O'Hara at Microsoft as well on the topic of using aria-haspopup. It's likely that the use of this role will imply that selecting the link will activate a popup, but will talk to Scott to get his thoughts and opinions.",

It is always interesting to discuss different schools of thought around code collaboration.\nGitHub as a whole doesn’t have much of a practice around commit messages but personally it hasn't bothered me too much because I can usually find the information I need as a reviewer in PR descriptions (at least in dotcom since a PR template is used). Generally, when I'm trying to gain context on the whats and whys of a change, I look through the PR description and comments. I don't really care about the intermediate commit messages though one can argue I would if they were written in a way that provides a lot of value. I do rely on commit messages more for my own benefit as I am working, but focus on writing a detailed PR description to provide context for others (and my future self). That's not to say I wouldn't be open to trying something new.\nI do think that implementing a set of practices reaps the most benefits when it is consistently adopted by those working together on the same codebase. More often than not, we are reviewing PRs of people on other teams and people in other teams are reviewing our PRs. What do you think about extending this discussion to outside our team? Some months ago we had a topic at UI engineering code review around squashing vs not squashing commits, so I think this would be a really interesting discussion to have in the next one (December 2nd).",

We'd all have to learn an existing standard instead of iterating on a newly-formed one we created, and if it stops serving our needs, we can revisit.\n\nI tend to squash and edit my commits when they get messy, so 👍  to @smockle 's point about enforcing better merge-to-main messages.

(Maybe you included this in your \"intentional component design\" point.)\nOur talk on Ephemeral environments might also make it easier to validate Primer work before we integrate into Dotcom if we can replicate our decisions in the Primer repos.\n\nRe:\n\nIf we make mistakes with functionality, we may not know until we come to integrate it with github/github\n\nI think we could import Primer using a GitHub commit url in package.json or a gemfile to validate in dotcom. Not that it's a perfect system, but it could allow us to be more confident with the integration before finishing Primer work.\nLast thought:\nI believe this is the anticipated workflow that Primer wants from us.

Ideally, Primer components can be made in Primer-first or app-level-first. We are working on paving a better path there. But. as our team name suggests, those processes takes some infrastructure work to set up 😄\nA north star for Primer is to be more self-serve.  That being said, components made app-level and upstreamed into the ecosystem (whether Alpha, Beta, Stable) have different requirements. Because they serve GitHub product as a whole, upstreaming components or creating them directly in the Primer repo requires these designs to serve at the system level. Shifting to developing directly in Primer right now would likely make Design Infrastructure a bottleneck. Experimental candidate components built app-level but aligned closely for upstreaming is a path forward.  As an example, we're working with @inkblotty on accessibility creating an app-level component and then us upstreaming it into Primer, with Design Infrastructure designers helping to get those components as 'upstream-ready' as possible. Meanwhile, the Design Infrastructure team is working on creating new system-level components directly in Primer as well as pushing the maturity of existing components forward.\nBasically, the idea of Experimental Candidate components (created outside of the Primer ecosystem initially) is to allow teams to create components as closely aligned with Primer Alpha components without creating an extra dependency.  @owenniblock can you tell me more about the specific case where you're encountering friction that's making you want to work in Primer directly?",

It would be much faster for the team to design and build the component in a way that works for their specific use case, and then upstream to Primer when and if we find more use cases for that component.\nIf we're pretty sure we're going to want a component in Primer, but we won't be able to get it to Alpha status in time to launch the feature, we can treat it as an Experimental Candidate that isn't in the component package's main bundle.

As well as the points others have noted about requiring a higher level of maturity and being locked into Primer release cycles, I have to stress how difficult the current workflow is for building a Primer ViewComponent that requires CSS additions/changes.\nUntil now ViewComponents have only been made when there was already an equivalent Primer CSS pattern in use so there hasn’t been any library race conditions. Some more recent changes to ViewComponents have used Primer CSS utility classes instead of dedicated Primer CSS component classes which have caused so many issues that we’re removing them all and outlawing that method of styling. Primer CSS and Primer ViewComponents are in separate repos and on separate releasing cycles so all the development has to happen separately. Testing your Primer CSS changes in Primer ViewComponents locally is painful (although @hectaherz and I are working on improving this), but the real problems arise if you want to make any changes to the API or styling after a component has first been introduced, which could mean 3 releases of each library to add a change, deprecate the previous feature, and then remove the previous feature. If a component is being developed inside github.com all you’d have to do is make the change in one PR. (n.b. Primer React doesn’t have this dependency issue because the CSS is written within the React libray)\nI’m with @tallys that I’d love love love adding to Primer directly to be the obvious choice which empowers people to make great, accessible components, but currently the infrastructure isn’t set up for that to be a productive workflow.",

I will provide a specific example I am running across in my tooltip work.\nAt GitHub, we have several custom web component elements that live in a standalone repo such as details-dialog, auto-complete. Following these paradigms, I am working on a tooltip web component with an HTML markup like:\n<button id=\"some-button\">👍</button>\n<tooltip data-type=\"label\"  for=\"some-button\">This is tooltip text for button</tooltip>\nwhich may eventually live in a standalone repo.\nWith this custom tooltip element, there are a couple of accessibility requirements I'd like to enforce:\n\nTooltip is adjacent to the trigger element.\nTooltip is set on interactive elements.\n\nThis check is very easy to do in runtime in JavaScript as one has access to exactly the trigger element renders as, and its location within the HTML tree. One approach would be throw a client-side JS error in the custom element code and prevent tooltip from appearing at all:\nthrow new Error('Tooltip is only allowed on interactive elements')\nThe downside is that client-side errors are not surfaced well to developers unless people are paying attention to their console. The one benefit is that it lets us take an explicit stance on how the element should be used (by not allowing an inaccessible element to render at all), without expecting the consumer to have a system like ours set up (axe, erblint, eslint, etc.) One idea we also discussed is to throw errors only in development mode or modify the UI in a very obvious way. This would achieve a similar purpose to axe, but\nmaybe there is a way to achieve this in standalone code for those outside our ecosystem.\nAnother route is not throwing errors at all even when a consumer is using the element inaccessible, and rely entirely on dev tools like axe and linters to surface accessibility violation. Linters are ideal as it shifts these accessibility checks as left as possible, but there are limitations. Some checks just won't be reliably enforced with ERB which doesn't have access to runtime info. You can see my full comment on limitations of ERB. Axe checks are also great but may still allow inaccessible code to be shipped. However, axe may still be surfaced more explicitly than a console error.\nThis has lead to some conversations we as a team don't have a clear stance on:\n\nWhat approach does our team want to take when it comes to enforcing accessible usage? Do we want inaccessible usage to break things completely?\nFor something like the standalone custom element repos we have, are there ways we can strongly nudge developers to consume the element accessibly outside of just documentation/pointing to other tools?\n\nParticularly, client-side errors aren't surfaced well and curious if others have some experience/ideas with this issue :)",

This is what we want.\nPractical view: If the dev is 100% flying solo (i.e., no testing by an a11y SME), is this realistic?\nIs there a middle ground? Something like:\n\nUse Primer (get a11y for free)\nNo issues when running a \"Fast Pass\"\nMore?\n\n\n\nTooling\nTo be blunt, do we have the right tools available to our devs? Are there tools that can go further than Fast Pass without needing to be an a11y SME?

Checklists and automation are, unfortunately, not sufficient on their own to guarantee any particular outcome.  However, trying to increase the use of Primer (or other components that are in a known good state) is a positive thing.\"\n\"Overall, this topic is extremely complex and should probably be prioritised for some synchronous time post-September.\nThe comments from @khiga8 are also worth talking about, i.e. \"It's very hard to convince a team to not release a feature after they've already built it...\".  I absolutely agree with this, and it is a recurring problem to solve at many orgs we have worked with.  There are times to be somewhat heavy-handed as in, having a policy that something proven to be inaccessible cannot ship, or timelines that teams must stick to in terms of fixing less severe a11y issues.  But those have to be paired with some strategies and willingness to work with a team earlier in the lifecycle, otherwise it's just like, \"we didn't tell you how to build an accessible component and now we're telling you how badly you did on your own\", sort of thing.\"",

We are in the process of scheduling audits and remediation for Q3 and Q4.\nSince the Education audit was completed several months ago, we need to understand if/how much the sites have changed. This will give us an idea if the findings from the audit still apply.\nIf some of the sites have changed, then a new audit would need to be scheduled in the future and aligned with engineering resources to start remediation shortly after the issues are reported.\nFor the findings that still apply we would need to schedule some time for your engineering team to work with the Accessibility team for remediation. There is some urgency to do this before all bugs become stale. At this time we are trying to schedule teams for Q3 and Q4. So we would need to know if this timing works for you. Please let us know.\nOur Accessibility audit and remediation process has also been evolving, this document explains how it currently works for all new audits:\nhttps://github.com/github/accessibility/blob/main/audit/process.md\nThanks! and I am happy to set up some time to chat and answer any questions.\ncc @arelia",

But anything beyond that, e.g. \"last Tuesday\", would be more of a cognitive burden than less.\nI'll also note that, as is the W3C's standard practice when it comes to neurodiversity, they don't provide any concrete examples of what \"alternatives\" and \"extra support\" represent.

That's not in a fit state to share quite yet.\nWCAG\nI think one of the most WAI useful tools for WCAG is the Quick Ref. It acts as useful gateway into all the WCAG resources at W3C. It is due a refresh very soon :)\n\nhttps://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/\n\nIn addition were are working on providing easier access to WCAG supporting resources like the techniques and ACT rules via the WAI website\nATAG\nI'm not sure how familiar you are with ATAG but it definitely seems relevant to you. I've picked up a ATAG tool project after Hidde left and I think it is very relevant to you. We've contacted a number of vendors who are keen to be involved and I'd love to add the GitHub a11y team.\nThe idea is to work with you as I refine the tool, providing feedback on how to make it most useful to you.\nThere are actually two tools capturing different but related information from Vendors like GitHub.\nATAG Report Tool\n\nhttps://www.w3.org/WAI/atag/report-tool/\n\nUseful to assess your maturity and highlight features. Also a good entry point for you on ATAG. We have a number of vendors working with us - mostly CMSs\nList of Vendors who provide authoring tools\nEarly Prototype - https://61aa02abfd6f71000883bec6--wai-authoring-tools-list.netlify.app/authoring-tools-list/\nMetadata about the vendor to supplement the Report\nPlease do let me know if you'd like to be involved in this effort.\nCollaboration\nI'm looking forward to working more with you both. I'll discuss the options with the WAI Team and get back to you.\nNormally people work with the W3C and hence the WAI by becoming a member. A W3C member organisation nominates a single representative who have access to various benefits. GitHub doesn't appear to be a member.\nhttps://www.w3.org/Consortium/membership",

This helps communicate to customers that we're working on Accessibility and that there will be more controls added in future.\nIf we can do this iteratively so as to get the most important controls to users asap, here's how I think we could prioritize. It would be great to align on this so that the design can be broken into near term and long term, and I'd guess you'd want the same for eng too.\n\nShip the on/off switch for keyboard users. Leave it defaulted to on by default for now, and not worry about hiding keyboard short hints from users. This seems like something we need to do asap so we solve problems immediately for customers and also show we are listening to feedback.\nFollow up with rollout to offer granularity with single vs multi-character keyboard shortcuts\nNext, change the default to off (it looks like y'all agree that's the right call). This will require communication to customers (though we could leave it on for all customers who haven't otherwise customized their settings to off, and default to off for any new customers, and introduce them to keyboard shortcuts settings via the existing tips)\nTips don't cause UX issues or address fine grained controls, so I'd de-prioritize this to later, at worst it might be a little confusing to those who switched them off, but I think we can live with that in the interim. When we do address, I think we should consider tips as a place to introduce them to the settings too, as per above. In terms of communicating to hubbers, I would suggest this be an item in part of a larger ship checklist for accessibility. Ideally we look for a systematic approach rather than individual one-off solutions too.\nNext, explore customizing, if we want to do that. That seems far into the nice to have category compared to the other issues.",

This page looks at having the keyboard shortcuts on the page and not hidden behind a button. There are no checkboxes to bulk enable/disable various features (though the options are available through a separate menu). Listing two GIFs along with explanatory text:\nFlow 1:\nRight now, some features have two different shortcuts that perform the same action. This first flow looks at how we could potentially keep them separate if users still wanted to different ways, or just one.\n\n\nUser clicks on the first shortcut key area for activating search, s, the area activates and the user presses the command and s keys to set a remap.\nTabbing brings the user to the next additional shortcut for the same feature. The user does not need a second method to reach the search feature on the keyboard so they tab to the next section, effectively leaving it blank.\nThe third area here is the 'more' menu, which provide the option to reset to default mapping or clear the keys mapping (rendering no shortcuts for the search feature)\n\nFlow 2:\nWhile GitHub has the ability to give multiple shortcuts for a feature (not recommended), if a user wants to remap, they can only choose one shortcut combo.\n\n\nUser clicks on the shortcut labeled, \" s or / \". It is activated by a click (or enter on a keyboard after focus).\nUser sets their desired shortcut by typing on the keyboard, command + s\nUser tabs out of the shortcut area to set their desired shortcut and moves to the \"more\" option on that row.\n\nNotes:\n\nThere are more questions that need to be answered on this page, like how do we display this if users set single key shortcuts to off?This was an exploration of interaction patterns with remapping only.\nZoom has a pattern that if you don't type anything after activating, the default stays the same when you exit. They also don't allow you to type more than one single character, even if you've used modifier keys.

Check boxes do not carry out actions, they allow a user to declaratively specify their preferences before submitting them at a later point.  If it were implemented, PAC would raise the proposed pattern as a WCAG violation in any future audit, and it definitely seems suboptimal to implement anything where we know that to be the case.\nI will always lobby for an explicit save mechanism wherever one makes sense and/or is possible.  However, if it has been determined that such a pattern is not feasible here, a possible alternative to a check box would be a toggle button.  That is, a <button> with aria-pressed, that would carry binary state like a check box, while also explicitly declaring that \"hey, this control does something\".\nWe have to be careful with toggle button labelling, though; the label shouldn't change based on state because this gets confusing very quickly.  For example, imagine hearing something like, \"Disable keyboard shortcuts toggle button pressed\".  Does this imply that shortcuts are currently enabled and that the button will disable them?  Or the other way around?  I'd suggest:\n\nLabel in all states: \"Enable keyboard shortcuts\" (or similar)\naria-pressed=\"true\" means that shortcuts are switched on.\naria-pressed=\"false\" means that they are not.",

Here are the main problem areas:\n\nCode editing experience (this is not VS Code in the browser)\n\nAccommodation within ecosystem: text editor\n\n\nCommenting on multiple lines of a pull request\n\nAccommodation within ecosystem: text editor with extension, maybe?\n\n\nProject boards\n\nAccommodation within ecosystem: none that I can think of.\n\n\nNetwork graph\n\nAccommodation within ecosystem: none that I can think of.\n\n\nCommand palette\n\nAccommodation within ecosystem: none that I can think of.\n\n\n\nApproaches\nIdeally, we'd like GitHub to be accessible no matter what setting has been chosen. That includes the keyboard setting. I can think of a few ways to approach this but I'd like your feedback and input.\n\nDo nothing, live with another a11y issue.\nDo something\n\nRemove these shortcuts from the scope of the shortcuts toggle. This means these features are still keyboard accessible but the toggle now becomes difficult to understand.\nWork on some quick wins which would improve the situation but do not address the root cause. For example, we could add a link to the command palette using the \"skip link\" method. This makes the feature available to keyboard and screen reader users without implementing a big change in the design.\n\n\nDo a lot\n\nImplement remap - this solves the issue but purists would argue that it doesn't solve the root cause\nRethink the UI of the features listed so that there is always an option in the UI which users can access when they have keyboard shortcuts turned off\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?

Gonna kick this off with my immediate thoughts for the first point:\n\nGap 1: Timezones\n\nI think that having two FR would be great if we had a larger team and even distribution of teammates in different timezones. As you mention, at our current team size&distribution, if we go with a FR in every major timezone, you would end up being on first responder every week which is not great...  I would think the biggest issue with timezone would be for urgent requests that come in while a first responder is offline.\nMaybe there is something we can learn from how ui-frameworks has been handling time zone differences with a similar distribution of team members and just one first responder (cc: @smockle and @JoseInTheArena?). I noticed that in the #js channel description, there's some expectations set around what to do for urgent requests:\n\n🚨 FR: @_______ For urgent requests: https://github.com/github/ui-frameworks/blob/main/first_responder.md\n\nSpecifically, in the linked doc, there's an expectation set that the team is distributed:\n\n@github/ui-frameworks-reviewers is a distributed team, and team members that can help more quickly might be online. You can find us in the #ui-frameworks channel.\n\nWe could set a similar expectation that it is okay to reach out to #accessibility-internal if a request is urgent and is going unnoticed because the first responder is not immediately available.",

Is very complete and we could maybe take it as a template for our new FR doc (I would be open to take the lead on modifying the current document to adapt it to that \"template\").\n\nI have a couple reservations about using Coding’s FR process as our template:\n\n\nCoding (the team that owns github/coding) is a feature team (that maintains Pull Requests, Repos, Codespaces, Gists, and Atom). In contrast, Accessibility is a platform team. Coding’s list of “FR Duties” includes “Questions and calls for help by other teams”. I suspect Coding has a relatively high volume of such requests as far as feature teams go (since Codespaces is the platform for github/github development), but in general, I suspect platform teams face a higher volume of internal support requests. Coding’s process may not scale to higher internal support volumes.\n\n\nExcluding managers, leads, product, and research, Coding has 25 engineering ICs. In contrast, Accessibility has 4 engineering ICs. We do not have capacity as a team to dedicate engineers to internal support; instead, as noted in our FR doc, this is a responsibility that is added to existing commitments. Maintaining this balance is easier with a lightweight FR process. Coding’s process may not be compatible with reduced staffing.\n\n\nReservations aside, I do appreciate you linking to Coding’s doc, @bolonio! It describes tactics that would be useful for us to adopt—in particular, I like the triage matrix and slash-command.",

What I want to say with this is that I've seen most of the issues in my previous company being estimated with numbers between 2 and 8, which is exactly the same as 4 categories of estimation where the name of the categories (rocks sizes, t-shirt sizes, numbers...) don't really matter. Now my vote would be to continue with rocks, not only because of my 4 categories theory, but as well to be consistent within GitHub (someone else is using the same scale, even if the complexity is not shared across teams).

The .fr chatop may be a helpful tool for finding at-mentions, but it should not replace the board, because only the board enables us to observe patterns over time (e.g. in retros). The FR board will include at least two columns—“Needs Triage” and “Triaged“—and the FR should make an effort to promote cards. However, as the FR remains responsible for their non-FR commitments, FR duties should be timeboxed to <1 hour/day. The FR should update the channel topic of #accessibility and #accessibility-internal with their name for discoverability.",

                    "bodyText": "React-based apps often rely on tools like eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y and jest-axe  to help detect code-level accessibility violations. As of now, I'm not aware of  many code-level accessibility linting tools available for Rails/ERB. One I came across that integrates with GitHub actions and lints ERB is AccessLint. It's not super invasive to developer workflow in that it will only lint newly changed code. To note though, this linter will not catch accessibility errors for Rails-y helpers like label_tag, image_tag, etc since it lints HTML. Regardless, it might still be worth looking into.\nThe most commonly used tool for automated accessibility testing in Rails is  axe-core-gems which allows for accessibility testing to be integrated into system tests. Currently there isn't support for minitest so we'll want to write our own wrapper around axe-core-api if we want this to work with our existing minitest specs.\nOne thing we did at my previous workplace with this axe gem was override all Capybara methods that would trigger a page change so that the axe assertion gets run whenever a page changed:\nexample:\noverriding capybara click_link method:\ndef click_link(link, accessible: true, **kwargs)\n  click_link(link, **kwargs)\n  if accessible?\n    expect(page).to be_axe_clean\n end\nend\n\nThis approach let us integrate accessibility checks within our existing system tests and we tracked accessibility regression based on how many accessible: false flags were set. Not sure we'd want to take this approach in dotcom but just one idea. Other things we might be able to do using axe-core-api is generate a report of all the detected accessibility violations across all integration tests, or on select key flows.",

Thanks for sharing.\nA few questions:\n\nWhat is a crawler?\nCould you elaborate what you mean when you say, the whole site gets scanned? I am envisioning the scan can only happen on pages that are accessed in the browser through an integration test flow (similar to how the axe-core-gems integrate).",

                    "bodyText": "Loving this conversation! I want to highlight that we don't think of accessibility as satisfying or working with screen readers. First, there are tons of other assistive technologies not being listed here (totally noting the issue is only about SR testing). However, the broader point is that IMHO we should never ever have as a goal to make something work with Jaws or NVDA or VoiceOver as a primary objective. It must be standards compliant and conformant to various specifications e.g. WCAG, ARIA, etc., and then follow best practices (we've highlighted some of these in our feedback and plan on providing a ton more after the formal audit work is done) and lastly be spot-checked with the assistive technologies in question.\nThe maintainer of Orca is the co-chair of the ARIA working group where I also happen to serve as an invited expert. It doesn't mean that in a perfect world we shouldn't be testing with Orca, but if any screen reader should be expected to conform to ARIA it will be the one maintained by her :).\nThe other reason for standards conformance is to prevent future bugs being introduced by current-day fixes. We may think we are being kind and do something where we break the rules, as it were, but we know it will make a component work better with JAWS. However, if JAWS then fixes the bug six months later, our fix may end up causing things to break instead of serving as a fix because it wasn't standards conformant so therefore we shouldn't expect it to work in the future even if it does now.\nIn terms of priorities, NVDA and Jaws pair nicely with different browsers so the recommendation we would make is NVDA+FireFox, JAWS+Chrome, VoiceOver+Safari. I would note here that NVDA works pretty well with Chrome, and so that should absolutely be reached for when debugging something because NVDA is far more likely to behave a bit more consistently whereas JAWS tends to take some opinionated approaches to things that can surface as really nuanced differences for non-SR-users.\nOne additional note, and maybe this issue isn't where to put this, but I want to make sure everyone is on the same page about this fact. VoiceOver is a completely different universe than JAWS and NVDA. While the two Windows screen readers for sure have differences, they follow an incredibly similar model for how to express and interact with the digital world. VoiceOver follows a very different model. This affects how forms and interactive elements are interacted with, how the OS is navigated, and what the expectations of users on that platform are. So, if folks will be  switching between them, please note that even seasoned expert power users of decades such as @jscholes  and myself have a significant context switching burden when using a Windows VS Mac-based screen reader.\nI hope this helps.",

                    "bodyText": "great question. If something is not truly supported then we won't recommend it. That combobox pattern should have never been in 1.1. It was just simply terrible. Only January of this year, if I recall my dates correctly, saw the major screen readers even supporting it. 1.2 on the other hand has been widely accepted by those working on the AT and the browsers like Chrome, etc., already works, and is far less technical debt to implement. In short, it's a win/win/win.\nBut, let's explore another example just to exercise the point you're correctly making. If there's a bug in Chrome that prevents aria-label from working correctly and we know it is being fixed, let's not go putting title attributes on things as a hack. Or, alternatively, if we know there's a bug in NVDA where it doesn't support lists with selection, but that this is well-documented in the ARIA spec and let's say beta already has a fix, then we should proceed. In short, I don't know that I would go so far as to suggest implementing something we know isn't supported by most AT, but if we know of a well-defined bug in one of them, we should direct our efforts to fixing the problem there not patching it here, if that makes sense.\nI hope that's clear, but apologies if not.",
